# SBA 308 JavaScript Fundamentals

## Introduction

The script is designed to run in the console and automatically generates results based on predefined parameters, utilizing control flow statements to dictate the flow of execution. It executes a series of calculations or data manipulations without requiring user input, employing conditional statements to determine which operations to perform. The output is displayed directly in the console, showcasing the results of each operation sequentially. The script includes built-in logging to track the operations performed and their outcomes. Finally, it concludes by summarizing the results, providing a clear overview of the computations carried out during its execution.

## Objectives

- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

### Instruction

> Create a script that gathers data, processes it, and then outputs a consistent result as decribed by a specification.
